# NOTE FROM MAINTAINER:
# I have to pin protobuf<6.0 here because some dependencies (like Google and Semgrep) don't support 6.x yet.
# Unfortunately, all protobuf 5.x versions have CVE-2026-0994 and there's no fixed release as of Jan 2026.
# If you don't use Google AI stuff, you could try protobuf>=6.34.0, but it might break other things.
# I'll update this as soon as a safe version is available—keep an eye out for dependency updates!
